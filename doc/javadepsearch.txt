INTRODUCTION                                          *javadepsearch*
This plugin is being made to stop switching between vim and the brwser when
searching for a specific version of a dependency on a java project. It is
developed with maven in mind, but there should be no problem on using gradle
instead.

COMMANDS                                          *javadepsearch-commands*
                                                  *javadepsearch-DepSearch*
:DepSearch                      This is the starting point for use of the
                                plugin. By invoking this command, the plugin
                                will create zoom current buffer, create a split
                                and populate the new buffer with the matching
                                artifacts for your query, takes two parameters,
                                the group Id and the artifact Id

WINDOWS                                           *javadepsearch-windows*
After running DepSearch and finding at least one result, a new window is open to
select the artifact that will be used on the build tool. This window is a
readonly vim buffer which higlights the current line to give feed back to select
an artifact. Once you select the articat, the contents of the window are
replaced to show the available versions of the artifact with its maven
coordinates and to select it by hitting enter. Once you hit enter, the new
window is closed and the previous layout should be restored
